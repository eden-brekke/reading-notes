## Git
 Git is a useful tool to allow you to collaborate between multiple developers on a software project. Git allows you to easily keep track of file revisions and makes the risk of data loss less prominant. 

You can easily clone your repositories to your IDE using git from sites such as GitHub, and then you have a mantra of add-commit-push for each time you make a change! Commit allows you to make a commit of why you made a change and lets you look back and why each change was made, If a change breaks your program this process makes it easier to revert back to an old version and continue on with your beautiful working project.
