## Reading
Consider the history: [That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

* What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
  * The rise of personal computers in homes! I guess also the 80s movies with the trope of geeky tech boi doin some neat stuff and winning the girl
* Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  * Familiarity with computers at the base level, gave them an advantage in an academic setting

Review the data: [Employee breakdown of key technology companies](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/)

* What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
  1. though women make up 51% of the population they don't typically make up that % in tech companies. Though in some they are close, additionally the highest % of women at one company is 50% meaning they never make up the majority of employees, only half. 
  2. White women do push higher majorities compared to white men
  3. In some companies asian ethnicity women do make up a sizable chunk compared to asian men, however ethnicity's of women don't tend to compare to their male counterpart in these tech companies. 
  4. Bonus Number 4, these numbers haven't changed much in the years reported (2014-2017) though they're getting a tiny bit higher as the year gets more recent

Ask the question: [Why diversity matters to your tech company](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)

* When are diversity efforts most successful?
  * Efforts are most successful when they're driven by a commitment from company leaders, meaning the leaders understand WHY diversity matters. 
* Why do diverse companies perform better?
  * Diversity offers benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation, brings more different ways of seeing a problem and thus better ways to solve it. 
* Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
  * One of the examples they gave (that I thought was silly but relevant) is their youtube example, when a fully right-handed team built the iOS app and that resulted in 5-10% of videos being uploaded upside down.
