# Professional Etiquette
Your strengths are your biggest assets. Being able to identify them to drive your value in the interview process is what separates you from other potential hires. Equally important is knowing your weaknesses and how they impact others. This allows the interviewer to see that you are self aware.

## Reflection
Complete the self-assessment form now with the link below. If you’ve done this before, try to look at each item with fresh eyes, not necessarily just plugging in the same answers as last time. Consider how you’ve grown over recent weeks and months!

As a reference, see definitions of the proficiencies.

## Analysis
The key to growth is to break down each area to increase your emotional intelligence and take ownership of yourself. Write a summary about the ways you plan to make professional improvements to leverage your top three and strengthen your bottom three competencies from your self-assessment. Incorporate any previous instructor feedback. Write your summary in a Google doc (giving anyone with the URL “comment” access), and submit the doc URL.

### Strengths: 

#### Accountability
__Behaves with responsibility for one’s role with quality and timeliness of deliverables while accepting responsibility when work does not meet expectations. Works toward a high standard of performance and provides helpful context/information on demand.__
I think of this as a strength for myself because it’s something I’ve always strived to be, accountable, responsible, and someone that my team members can count on. I like to produce works that I’m proud of, within a timely manner. In the times that my work has not met expectations I tend to put in extra care to fix and rework the assignment so that it meets expectations, as well as applying that knowledge in my following projects. I take critique as a learning experience that can only help, not hurt my performances. 

#### Process
__Prioritizes and completes assigned tasks according to team's process. Consults with more senior teammates on how and when to ask for help. Aligns with team’s management style, best practices and processes. Addresses issues on-demand as a standard rule.__
This is a strength of mine because I take careful notes of what is expected of me, I’m not afraid to ask for help when I’m lost, or extend a helping hand when I’m not lost. Adapting to a team’s process has always been an easy task for me as well, I work well when there are guidelines and a standard rule for me to adhere to, even if the rules and practices are different than what I have previously been exposed to. 

#### Mentorship
__Ability to mediate in or across teams. Models good judgement and business decisions to complete work. Willingness to give or receive guidance to improve overall skills and abilities, leaving a positive impact through leading by example.__
I often find myself in leadership roles, despite myself. I tend to try to take a backseat when it comes to team processes, do my work, and do it well. However, if I see that someone is struggling I will absolutely offer a helping hand, slow down, explain what I’m doing and get them on the same page as me. I’m also not afraid to be on the other end of that, if someone has figured out a neat new method I haven’t used, I’m eager to ask questions and learn. This ‘mentorship’ is something that I think has always been inherent to how I hold myself in life, but I didn’t realize the name for it until my last instructor’s final review feedback, where she called me a mentor, and told me to own the skill. 


### Weaknesses:

#### Creative
*Procedurally suggests improvements that could increase the velocity of software delivery. Is open to new ideas and willing to appropriately challenge the status quo.*
I think of this as a weakness cause I tend to just go along with what I’m told to do and I struggle a bit when it comes to ‘challenging the status quo’, I need to work on the confidence for my own ideas but also to get better at thinking up my own ideas. 

#### Innovation
*Generates new ideas for meeting customer needs by effectively using customer interaction and research. Proactively identifies and manages risks within scope and resolves issues via an established process or with coaching. Develops multiple options for fulfilling customer needs.*
This is similar to the weakness above, creativity, I think going against the status quo and thinking of new ideas is something I’ve always struggled with, I need to really understand a problem before I can start thinking of new ideas, and even if I have a thorough understanding of the problem I think I get a bit of a ‘stage paralysis’ where I don’t think my idea will work, so I don’t bother suggesting it. 

#### Handling Ambiguity
*Functions effectively on limited information and not fully understanding the whole picture. Finds a way forward when there aren't clear next steps and works through open ended questions while maintaining a constructive attitude in times of stress. Can participate in creation of solid design with vague requirements. Can change strategies quickly when initial approach doesn’t work.*
This is another weakness of mine, I do best under conditions where I understand very well, and I get paralyzed when I don’t understand. If I don’t understand an assignment or how to get started, it’s hard for me to do just that, get started. Once I am started I can usually stumble my way through with little guidance but it’s not my best work, nor is it a comfortable environment for me. I desire to get better at this skill because I think it’s very important and I would benefit from it greatly in the professional world.
