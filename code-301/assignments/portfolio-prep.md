# Portfolio Prep
In your first few days of Code 301, you will build a personal portfolio site. This will help you establish a home on the web, and show off some of your software development projects and skills.<br>

Sometimes, the hardest part is getting the words right. To help you prepare for building your portfolio, you can start thinking about what you want to say now.

## Tell me about yourself
Visitors to your portfolio site want to learn about you, in memorable, bite-sized bits. Your page will have a space for you to fill in each of the following descriptions of yourself:

1. A 2 or 3 word catchy title. Avoid cliches like “programming ninja” or “coding rockstar”.
  : Not Sure Virus Programming Scientist 
2. A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about? 
  : I want my career to be about making a difference in science and medicine through the power of technology. 
3. Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.
  for now : 

I'm trained in the field of Virology Research and I've spent that career as a research scientist and manager for small labs. Where I conducted my own experimental design while managing a team to further the scientific research of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and understanding of RNA viruses as a whole.<br>
 
During my time as a research scientist, a software engineer, out of the kindness of her heart, wrote us a simple program that changed a fundamental assay in our day to day life.<br>
This simple program made something that took us -hours- to complete, instead take -minutes- to complete. I was amazed and intrigued by just how a few lines of code could transform our experience in the lab.<br>
 
After seeing this I quickly decided that I wanted to pursue this path, and it just turned into a matter of "how." I had already attended university, and although I enjoyed my time at university, I wasn't keen on going back! I decided to explore other avenues, and having contact with a few people who attended Code Fellows and through that successfully inserted themselves into the industry.<br>
 
I decided to follow in their footsteps with the ultimate goal of going back into science with my software development skills. I want to advance virology research through the power of coding. <br>

4. What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.
  : Technology is in everything, it's the way of the world and the way of thinking that is required for it excites me, and drives me to be a better thinker, better problem solver, better me. I have first hand experience of seeing technology automate a complex assay into a few lines of code, imagine what it could do with the right minds behind it? 

## Gather your assets
A few punchy images will really help your page stand out, and make it your own. Gather images for the following:

1. A headshot of your lovely face, reduced to 100x100 pixels ![image](../../images/20220115_141925.jpg) it's me!<br>
2. A banner of you looking happy, cropped to exactly 1400 × 422 pixels ![image](../../images/pumpkinbanner.png) it's pumpkin :) <br>
3. A screenshot of the best-looking part of your favorite previous project, like your Code 201 final project ![image](../../images/codlehomepage.png) My teams final Code 201 project: CODLE and a round played/results pop up <br>
4. Two or three other nice-looking screenshots, of any other projects you have worked on. Salmon Cookies? Bus Mall? 
  ![image](../../images/cookiestand.png) My Salmon Cookies Lab DOM manipulated Table<br>
  ![image](../../images/busmall.png) My Bus Mall Results page/chart<br>
  ![image](../../images/catfamily.png) My About me Bio and Cat family<br>
