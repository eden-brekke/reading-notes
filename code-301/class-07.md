## Reading
[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)
If you took Code 201, skim this article again for a refresher. If you did not take Code 201, read this article and think about how it can influence the way you work with your partners during pair programming.
I took Code:201 about two weeks ago, so I remember this is mostly about psychological safety. 

[How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)
* Who is Roy Fielding?
  * "some guy, he's smart" in the conversation he's the guy who taught "me" about web servers. 
* Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
  * because it would be a lot of machines asking other machines for information, kinda like that telephone game, would be difficult to process. 
* What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
  * it's all about applying verbs to nouns, when you go to a webpage the browser does an http get on the url and brings you back the webpage you requested. 
* What does a GET do?
  * grabs information from a database/library/api
* What does a POST do?
  * creates new resources 
* What does PUT do?
  * utilizes the updates 
* What does PATCH do?
  * used to modify capabilities 

## API Keys

Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.
