# Behavioral Interview Prep

Preparing for your behavioral questions early is a MUST because you WILL be asked these types of questions in the interview process. Preparing now is a vital step in becoming the lead candidate for the role. Your answers need development and curation time. The more you practice and receive feedback the better you sound when sharing your experiences.

## Assignment

If you haven’t already, create your own collection of answers to common behavioral questions by making a copy of this [template.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u02dYTGk9F8eVi59HABVF2HP_ksNW1svfKMZ8nuYkmk/edit)

Write out responses to 3 new behavioral questions from this [top-ten list.](https://theinterviewguys.com/top-10-job-interview-questions/) Remember to answer in the [S.T.A.R.](https://careerservices.wayne.edu/pdf/behavioralinterviewinfo.pdf) format, which is the expectation standard.

## Highlight Positive Results

NOTE: Behavioral questions that involve tension situations (e.g. tell me a time when you worked with someone difficult, when did you make a mistake, or when did you disagree) should always have a good outcome. Never tell a story about an experience where you leave the interviewer thinking that someone was marginalized by you or a group. Instead, you want the interviewer to know that you handled a difficult situation and everyone lived happily ever after. Luckily, you get to choose the situation you will talk about!

Allocate 30 minutes to this assignment

TA’s will be grading you on your behavioral questions and answers written out using the S.T.A.R. format. Students should copy/paste in new S.T.A.R. format answers for classmates to review. So, paste in what you wrote in your doc to the class discussion to share. (If you tested into 301 please answer six questions.) Everyone should have at least six questions in their template in 301.

#### Question 1: Give me a specific example of a time when a co-worker or classmate criticized your work in front of others. How did you respond? How has that event shaped the way you communicate with others? (oral communication.) 

Situation: During my time as a Lab manager a weekly practice was to attend lab meetings. In lab meetings each week one person would present their research work in progress, or an interesting scientific paper that they found within our field of study. Alternatively we would do bi-monthly journal clubs, where three-four people within our lab meeting would choose papers to present. <br>

Task: During a journal club, I was one of the presenters and I had chosen a paper that pertained to my particular project, looking at the gene I studied in relation to a virus that I did not study. During my presentation I had interpreted a figure within a paper incorrectly, and a participant of the lab meeting interrupted me and criticized my interpretation in a way that brought my intelligence into question. <br>

Action: Instead of letting this criticism fluster me and throw my presentation flow off, I embraced the criticism, and asked for help to understand the figure better. Previously in my career I had let criticisms get me down and make the remainder of my work that day be not up to my standards. So taking the time to breathe and ask for help instead of just moving on was a good step for me. <br>

Result: I was able to learn more about virology as a whole and data interpretation, as well as understanding the importance of asking for help when I’m not quite sure that I have a firm grasp on a subject. Going forward in my career I’ve implemented this by taking more careful time in interpretation of data and making sure I have a firm grasp on what I’m presenting. <br>

#### Question 2: Describe the system you use for keeping track of multiple projects. How do you track your progress so that you can meet deadlines? How do you stay focused? (commitment to task)

Situation: While attending university and working as a lab manager, time and task management is a big factor for success. There are many instances where you have to juggle multiple classes and projects and if you let yourself get behind it’s easy for that 
to snowball and for you to get buried under the weight of time-snow. <br>

Task: Time and task management is easiest for me when I have multiple methods of tracking them. So I set myself up for success by implementing more than one safety net. <br>

Action: As soon as I’m assigned with a task, I will log it in my planner. I have a running to-do list that I can check items off as I go. I’ll put a tentative date next to each list item and on each date in my google calendar I will expand that list item into small list items. Using the combination of a planner, a to-do list, self imposed due dates and google calendars is how I keep myself organized and accountable for my projects. On-top of this I always try to overestimate how much time a task will take me, ensuring that I will not run out of time or fall behind in my work. <br>

Result: I’m rather reliable when it comes to team projects and since I overestimate how much time I need for my own tasks, this means that I often have extra time to help others when they need it. Alternatively this means that if I finish my assigned task for the day I’m able to start work on my next tasks. This means I’m able to get projects done in a timely manner, sometimes sooner than projected. Due to my tendency to finish tasks early, I’m able to take on more projects and apply my quick work times to getting tasks done for the company. Often during my time in the lab being quick allowed me to spend more time writing grants and submitting them before their deadlines, allowing our lab to get more funding quicker. <br>
