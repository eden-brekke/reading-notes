# Professional Pitch Draft

Single most powerful professional tool you can use in your career is the ability to talk about yourself as an asset to drive your value. <br>
Practicing, iterating, and refining your pitch is how to carve out this narrative of you. <br>

Prep wok Assignment: Create a 60 Second video of your professional pitch, make notes of how to improve it and record it again as many times as needed. <br>

Submission: a link to the video, Google Pictures app will work nicely for this. <br>

## Guidelines

A professional pitch is a clear and brief message about you. Conveys who you are, what you do, and how someone can benefit from your value by sharing your impact on tech. 

### How to prepare

1. Know your "why" be able to talk about your purpose on this planet, your why separates you from all other applicants by being able to share your life's vision and mission. More importantly, when applying you need to be able to share your purpose and value while coupling it with their vision and mission.
2. Write it down! Include your past in your story, but don't go into details, rabbit hole, or focus on it too much. You want to show potential employers that you have accomplishments and work experience that will benefit their company, product and team. Share your love for tech and why this skill is your passion, and the current impact you are making as a tech professional. 
3. Format it. Make sure that it answers three questions. Who are you (name and history), what you do (job title), and what value you bring (your why/passion). Prepare a few different variation that you can use depending on who you are meeting. Master a few talking points for longer conversations. 
4. Practice out loud. Make it smooth until it no longer sounds rehearsed. It'll feel awkward at first but that's the only way to get a polished pitch. Read it aloud all the time to whoever will list, or just in front of a mirror. Try it out on friends and fellow students and video record it for self assessment critique. Muscle memory will win every time when you are nervous, you will default to what you have practiced when you feel nervous.
5. Be confident in your body language. Practice and then practice some more. It makes you feel comfortable and confident. Remember this is your story and own it. Be confident and look everyone in the eye, stand tall, sile. use your hand gesture (no hands in pockets or crossed arms over chest), control how much you are moving. 
6. If applicable, remove the name of where you studied, we are honored to be a part of your journey but we are not your skill, your stack is your skill. It' important that you work on your own personal branding, and when you use the name of your school in your story it highlights that you just graduated as a tech professional. Approach the market with the force of "I am a software developer" vs I just graduated. Remember that you may be new to the industry but not brand new to the concepts that are required, you come with experience, professionalism and passion.

Keep your pitch under 60seconds. you will be graded on timing, fluid and natural delivery of your story, and clearly stating the who, what and why of yourself. Remmeber to start with what you are, with a background in X (virology for me) and your contributions and impact as a professional on a team and why technology is your passion. Tell your unique story. 

### My Story.

From Code 201: <br>
I'm trained in the field of Virology Research and I've spent that career as a research scientist and manager for small labs. Where I conducted my own experimental design while managing a team to further the scientific research of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and understanding of RNA viruses as a whole. <br>
During my time as a research scientist, a software engineer, out of the kindness of her heart, wrote us a simple program that changed a fundamental assay in our day to day life. <br>
This simple program made something that took us -hours- to complete, instead take -minutes- to complete. I was amazed and intrigued by just how a few lines of code could transform our experience in the lab. <br>
After seeing this I quickly decided that I wanted to pursue this path, and it just turned into a matter of "how." I had already attended university, and although I enjoyed my time at university, I wasn't keen on going back! I decided to explore other avenues, and having contact with a few people who attended Code Fellows and through that successfully inserted themselves into the industry. <br>
I decided to follow in their footsteps with the ultimate goal of going back into science with my software development skills. I want to advance virology research through the power of coding. <br>
