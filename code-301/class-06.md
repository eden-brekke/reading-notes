* What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
  *  npm install -g jshint
* What is node used for?

[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)
* What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
  1. Greater Efficiency -- when two people focus on the same code it's easier to catch mistakes 
  2. Engaged collaboration -- experience is generally more engaging when both programmers are focused on the code. Also harder to procrastinate 
  3. Learning from fellow students -- everyone has different perspectives, this will help expose developers to techniques they wouldn't have otherwise used. 
  4. Social skills -- helps to grow and improve social skills, when working with someone who has a different style, communication is huge. 
  5. Job interview readiness -- common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between you and interviewer. Lets the company get a better feel for how you'll fit into the team
  6. Work environment readiness -- many companies utilize pair programming 
* In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
  * I haven't had the opportunity to be the driver yet for pair programming, though it's been part of the assignments it's never ended up working out that way, so I'm eager to try that out. As the navigator I valued having to spell out everything that I wanted the driver to type and sometimes why I wanted them to type that. 
* How does pair programming work?
  * one person drives (types) and one person navigates (tells the driver what to type) in goals to build a program.

## Things I want to know more about
As stated in my answers I'd really like the opportunity to be the driver in a pair programming situation.
