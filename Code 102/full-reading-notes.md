# Interested in Software Development, but Overwhelmed?

Software is a great equalizer and to get started on learning how to develop software, all you need is a GitHub account! <br>
On your GitHub account you can create repositories, to publish your own free website using a simple ReadMe file with some Markdown and some determination. <br>

###### Markdown? Why not Markup? 

Markdown is a lightweight form of coding that allows you to create things such as websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation, it can range from very basic to advanced. Making it an easy way for you to share the information most important to you. <br>
Here are great resources out there to provide you with the a wonderful [Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for Markdown as well as some more advanced, but still [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for Markdown. <br> 
With these tools, building your website is only a few keystrokes, some clicks, a bit of *google fu* and a mindset away. <br>
Mindset you ask? There are two common Mindsets when you're in a learning environment. Fixed Mindset, and Growth Mindset. <br>

|Fixed Mindset| **Versus** |Growth Mindset|
|:---:|:---:| :---: |
|To *Fail*| **Tendency** |To *Succeed*|
|*Daunting*| **Challenges** |*Exciting*|
|*Waning* Focus| **Obstacles** |Interesting *Challenge*|
|*Pointless*| **Effort** |*No Pain, No Gain*|
|Will *ignore*| **Critisism** |Will *learn* from|
|Is *discouraging*| **Success of Others** |Is *Inspiring*|


## What does a Growth Mindset mean to me?

To have a **growth mindset**, it means that you are willing to step out of your <em>comfort zone</em>.
It is the idea that even though you don't know something about a topic, that doesn't mean that you can't learn about the topic. 
If you go into a topic without any knowledge, even if you end up failing, you can pick yourself back up and learn from your failings and mistakes, and realize that those mistakes were an important part of the learning process. 


### Reminders of How to stay in a growth mindset

1. **Mistakes** are <em>important</em> and <em>essential</em> to the learning process
2. Give your mind **breaks**, let the information digest, don't forget to <em>ask for help</em>
3. Stay diligent and **keep trying**, remember that <em>google</em> is a great friend <br>

## Cheat Sheet for Commands Learned

* ls = List the contents of a directory.
* cd = Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
* file = obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
* ls -a = List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
* l = Long listing
* \ = An escape character, escapes the meaning of the next character
  * Example: putting \ before an * will ignore the function of bolding a character in markdown, instead displaying the * in the text.
* .. = To back out of a directory path one step
* . = A reference to your current directory
* ~ = A shortcut for your home directory
* ls /etc = Running the List command but telling the terminal to not list your current directory, but the directories contents
* mv <source> <destination> = move a thing to a place
* cp <source> <destination> = copy a thing to a place
* rm <file> = remove a file
* mkdir = make a directory
  * -p = make a parent directory
  * -v = view an action
* n = next term
* touch <filename> = create a file with filename
* vi (or) vim = inline text editor
* control + c = copy to clipboard
  * right click = paste
* git clone URL = clone items into your IDE
* git add File = Add a file to your project
* git commit -m "Comment" = Allows you to commit the changes you've made to your main file with a comment of why the change was made
* git push URL = pushes your committed changes to your project
* git status = allows you to see the status of your changes and if you need to commit 

## Tips and Tricks
* Use Tab to auto complete actions 
* Two Types of Paths 
  * **absolute**
  * **relative**
* Commands are stored after used. 
  * You can use your up and down arrow keys to navigate commands you've recently used.
* Everything is a file in Linux(WSL). 
  * Including directories.
* Linux(WSL) is an extensionless system. 
  * Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
* Linux(WSL) is case sensitive. 
  * This can cause silly issues.

## Common Acronyms
* IDE = Integrated development environment
* DNS = Domain Name System
* VCS = Version Control System
* CVCS = Centralized Version Control System
* DVCS = Distributed Version Control systems 

 
## Git
 Git is a useful tool to allow you to collaborate between multiple developers on a software project. Git allows you to easily keep track of file revisions and makes the risk of data loss less prominant. 

You can easily clone your repositories to your IDE using git from sites such as GitHub, and then you have a mantra of add-commit-push for each time you make a change! Commit allows you to make a commit of why you made a change and lets you look back and why each change was made, If a change breaks your program this process makes it easier to revert back to an old version and continue on with your beautiful working project.
 
 ## Wireframes
 Wireframes are an important step to web development, this allows you to draft a concept and structure for what you want your app or website to look like. Allowing you to get rolling on the project. Changes to the structure are expected as you continue on. <br>
 
 6 Steps of Wireframes are: <br>
1. Do Research
2. Reference Research
3. Map out user flow
4. Draft/ Sketch
5. Add Details and Test
6. Turn your wireframe into the prototype app

 ## HTML 
 HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that denotes the structure of your website. HTML is a series of elements creating the structure. An HTML element has Tags(Opening and closing) as well as attributes and contents within the tags. <br>
 HTML has both semantic (distinct meanings of the elements) and non-semantics (asethetic, presentation elements) elements available to it. <br>
 Some examples of semantic HTML elements are: nav, footer, header, article, main, strong <br>
 Some examples of non-semantic HTML elements are: div, span
