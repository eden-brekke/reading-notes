# Implementation: Stacks and Queues

To turn in your reading “Reply” to this discussion by teaching something that you learned. Then review what one of your classmates learned, and leave a comment.

Some ideas for how you might want to teach:

* Use an analogy
* Explain a detail in depth
* Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
* Tutorial / walk through an example
* Write a quiz
* Create a vocabulary/definition list
* Write a cheat sheet
* Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
* Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
* Build a map of the information
* Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic

Terminology for a Stack: 
1. Push  -- Nodes or Items that are put into the stack are 'pushed' and has a BigO of O(1)
2. Pop -- Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are 'popped' and if you try to pop an empty stack you'll get an exception and has a BigO of O(1)
3. Top -- Top of the stack
4. Peek -- When you peek you will view the value at the top Node in the stack. If you attempt to peek an empty stack you'll get an exception and has a BigO of O(1)
5. IsEmpty -- returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false and has a BigO of O(1)


Common terminology for a queue is:
1. Enqueue where the node/item are added to the queue and has a BigO of O(1)
2. Dequeue where nodes/items are removed from queue and has a BigO of O(1)
3. Front is the front/first Node in queue
4. Rear is the rear/last node in queue
5. Peek similar to before looks at the first node and has a BigO of O(1)
6. IsEmpty similar to before means the queue is empty and has a BigO of O(1)



Both Stacks and Queues have: 
FILO -- Stands for First in Last Out and means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack/queue

LIFO -- Stands for Last in First Out and means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack/queue
