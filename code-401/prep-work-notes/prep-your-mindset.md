# Prep Your Mindset

## Tasks

While this is a technology course, success with the deluge of work within depends heavily on the mindset that you bring to the table.

With that in mind, this is some prework to get us all on the same page about dealing with difficulty in our lives.

* Read [Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice) (10 minutes)
  * Just programming doesn't make you BETTER, you need to challenge yourself! Deliberate Practice!
  * You're highest rate of learning is at the beginning of your career because you are being pushed out of your comfort zone.
  * You can't rely on your job to challenge you, you need to seek out those challenges
  * The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:
    * pushes you out of your comfort zone
    * you repeat it often
    * feedback on the results is continuously avilable
    * highly demanding mentally
    * difficult
    * requires good goals
  * there are sites that have sets of exercises that fit this criteria for many devs
    * matasano crypto challenges and rosalind are two examples
    * Go to it! do the work! be better :)
* Watch [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset.](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en) (10 minutes)
  * the power of "yet"
  * just because you haven't succeeded now doesn't mean you wont get there
  * your abilities can be developed.
  * the tyranny of now (oh nooo) this is fixed mindset 
  * fixed mindset runs from the error, but the growth mindset engage and know that everything can be learned
  * praise the process of improvement
  * effort and difficulty is when you're making new neuronal connections, it's when you're learning most.
* Watch [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit.](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance) (6 minutes)
  * what we need in education is understanding of humans from a motivation/psychological perspective rather than IQ
  * Why are we successful? grit.
  * grit is passion and perseverance for long term goals
  * living life like its a marathon not a sprint 
  * talent doesn't make you gritty, talent doesn't make someone follow through on their commitments.
  * one correlation with grit is a growth mindset
* Watch [Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success) (17 minutes)
  * Is there relief from the pressures of society and life? Don't pass judgement on people based on the very small window you have into their lives
  * we fear failure because of judgement and ridicule of others
  * Modern society causes anxiety because we have nothing at the center that is non-human
    * we tend to think very highly of ourselves
  * we think we know what success means: a lot of money or renowned 
    * the speaker says you can't be successful at everything, any vision of success has to admit where the element of loss is
    * a lot of the time our ideas of what success are, aren't our own
    * so we should focus in on our own success, so that we are the authors of our own ambitions
* Assess your [emotional intelligence.](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/201/emotional-intelligence-assessment.html) If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently. [Assessment](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/201/emotional-intelligence-assessment.pdf)
  * It seems as though I just barely scraped by and my lowest score of the 4 attributes is 18. When I took this previously I remember that I scored lower, and I think that going through Code Fellows has made me take a step back and really evaluate the aspects I was lacking in. I do sometimes struggle with knowing how I make others feel, but I try to be vulnerable and open to feedback in that aspect. Although according to assessment I "don't need improvement" I do think that I will always want to keep working towards doing better. Better by others, and by my self. I want to make sure that I'm always a safe place for others to come to and talk with. I want to make sure I'm always honest with myself and with others as well. I do think we are always learning and working to be better humans to each other.
* Assess [your biases.](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.html) If you have done it in the past, now you can identify the areas you have grown in recently. [Assessment](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.pdf)
  * My areas of strength in bias is that I know what a bias is and that they're a part of being human, that makes it easier to identify and work towards not falling victim to my own biases and treating others unfairly. My weakest area is that while I do my best to advocate for others I am not a good advocate for myself. I have a tendency to second guess myself, think I'm being too sensitive or making problems that aren't there. I often will have to take someone aside for a one-on-one and talk to them and ask if I'm making the issue up or if a bias is actually acting against me. Even in those given situations when others see it happening to me, I have issues standing up for myself. I think I also need to work on preemptive action, before a bias against a peer even comes up, I'd like to have preventative actions I can take in advocacy for them. We are always growing and I know that I'm not perfect with checking my own biases, but I do try hard to take a step back and not judge people based on a small window of their life that I've seen.
