[Matplotlib Tutorial](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial)

Used for 2D graphics 
IPython: enhanced interactive pythong shell. includes named inputs and outputs, ability to access to shell commands, improved debugging and more!
Pyplot: convenient interface for object-oriented plotting library

plot() method will display the plot
plt.plot(linewidth =) lets you adjust the width
plt.plot(linestyle =) lets you adjust the style
plt.plot(color =) lets you adjust the color

You can set limits with
xlim() and ylim()

Customize graph ticks with
xticks() and yticks()
set_xticklabels() and set_yticklabels()
tick containers, locating and formattinng

Can adjust spines (the y and x axis lines where the tick marks show up)
And you can add a Legend with theh legend()
Can pick a specific point to add an annotationt too (annotate())

Basically what I'm gathering from this is that if you can think of a way to adjust and edit the graph, then matplotlib can do it

You can even create animations with it

Other types of plots:
* regular plot
* scatter plot
* bar plot
* contour plot
* imshow
* quiver plot
* pie chart
* grid
* multiplot
* polar axis
* 3d plots
* text

The world of plots is expansive and what you can do with matplotlib seems unending, but the docs are verbose and ready to be called upon at anytime :)
