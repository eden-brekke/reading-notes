[Encryption, Decryption & Hacking](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:online-data-security/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:data-encryption-techniques/a/encryption-decryption-and-code-cracking)

-   Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
-   Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
-   Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.
-   Frequency Analysis: E is the most common letter in the english letter, so in a large body of data E can be easy to find
-   Plain Text: if you know some of the original data it becomes easy to crack the rest of it 
-   Brute force: only 25 possible iterations of code, so you try each till the message makes sense. 

[Ceasar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
- Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques
- Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
- Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD

	-   There is no such thing as a 100% secure system
	-   Cryptography : secret writing
	-   Cipher: gibberish until you have a key
	-   Encryption : make gibberish 
	-   Decryption: undo gibberish
