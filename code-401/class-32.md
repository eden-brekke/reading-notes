## Reading

[DRF Permissions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/)


Together authentication ad throttling will determine whether a request should be granted or denied access for a website. 


How Permissions are determined:
* the request was successfully authenticated but permission was denied will produce a HTTP 403 error
* the request was not successfully authenticated and the highest priority authentication call does not use WWW-Authenticate headers will also produce a 403 error
* The request was not successfuly authenticated and the highest priority authentication class does use WWW-Authenticate headers will produce a 401 error

REST framework permissions support object level permissioning which is used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object. 

API reference:
* **AllowAny** is a permission calss that will allow unrestricted access regardless of it the request was authenticated or not
* **IsAuthenticated** will deny permission to any unauthenticated user and allow permission otherwise
* **IsAdminUser** permission class will deny permission to any user unless they're admin
* **IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly** will allow authenticated users to perform requests but will allowed anonymous users to still read
* **DjangoModelPermissions** ties into Djangos standard model permissions
* **DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly** similar to above but will allow anonymous users to read
* **DjangoObjectPermissions** Ties into djangos standard object permissions framework that allows per-object permissions on models. 

Third Part Packages:
* **DRF- Access Policy** provides a way to define complex access rules in declarative policy classes
* **Compose Permissions** provide simple way to define complex and multi=depth permission objects
* **REST Condition** another extension for building complex permissions
* **DRY Rest Permissions** provide the ability to define different permissions for individual default and custom actions
* **Django Rest Framework Roles** Make its easier to parameterize your API over multiple types of users
* **Django REST Framework API key** provides permissions classes, models, and helpers to add API key authorization to your API
* **Django Rest Framework Role Filters** filtering over multiple types of roles
* **Django Rest Framework PSQ** is an extenstion that gives support for having action-based permission_classes, serializer_class and queryset dependent on permission based rules
