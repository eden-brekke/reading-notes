Advice: Communicate
The ebst piece of technical interview advice is that you should be constantly communicating. Ask questions and make sure you're understanding correctly. Ask for the interviewers opinion on what you've done. 

Reiterate the problem: the input: the output. 

Ask about edge cases.

Ask about test cases and suggest test cases

Write pseudocode and ask if it makes sense

Write actual code and ask if it looks good

If you get stuck, you can ask for help, it's not illegal! just phrase it conversationally
the example they give:
"I'm a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?"

Remember that we're all human

[6 Tips](https://blog.usejournal.com/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6)
1. Take a few minutes, don't waste precious minutes by filling it with nervous chatter
2. Write down steps of the solution (algorithm)
3. Write pseudocode first
4. Don't sweat the small stuff, if you can't remember something small its often acceptable to say that you'd look it up
5. Sit down and be humable. There are plent of things that fall into the making you a good dev besides code:
	1. are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively
	2. do you treat the interviewer with respect
	3. how do you accept criticism
	4. are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions
	5. do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy
	6. are you honest (especially about yourself)
6. come prepared!
7. Review your work! Sometimes you won't have time but if you have a few minutes left it's good to look back over your code this gives you an opportunity to fix silly mistakes. 

 These two areas are the two that receive heavy scrutiny in interviews:
 1. Algorithmic efficiency: have you found the fastest and most optimal solution given the requirements? Take some time and consider other approaches. Its worth noting two things here: a) if the problem involves sorted dataset you can be that there's a solution involving O(log(n)) look up time. b) for disgustingly large number of programming interview questions the answer involves a hashtable and O(1) look up time, so if youre seeking a better algorithm try a hashtable
 2. Correctness: sure you've solved for the simple, easy use case, but have you checked for edge cases? off-by-one errors? issues with negative numbers or empty arrays or missing keys or strings with weird patterns of characters? maybe you wont find them all but you should at least LOOK for edge cases before declaring your solution to be correct.
